Two examples: my uni recently purchased a new system that will help us manage data for accreditation processes. The dean was very excited that the system came with a free ePortfolio tool. How great to save money by getting it free with something we had to buy anyway! But of course, this ePortfolio tool is totally wrapped into and serving the accreditation process, which is really different than the kind of learner-controlled ePortfolios we were talking about initiating.  Most fac and staff on the tech committee didn't know anything about the ethics of big data or how data is used by/for/against students, so we were really vulnerable to being sold a product by an EdTech company who knew exactly what we didn't really understand.  Another example: our Student Success™ coaches are a bought-and-paid-for predictive analytics algorithm.  Say what you will about that, most of our faculty don't even KNOW this.  They think it's ""personalized advising."" It's hard to talk about the pros and cons of the collection of this data or the use of these predictive models with colleagues when the EdTech companies obscure their methods in the language of student-centered pedagogies.  So much to love in this article, and I know I am just taking a tiny nugget here and going in a different direction, but just thinking about how to begin to talk about these issues with my colleagues, and realizing the digital literacy issue is a really significant hurdle."

Do students know they are being tracked, and do they have the option to opt out? That is important. In the FT article, in one of the pilots students could sign up to have their information connected to them personally (rather than just being collected in aggregate form). Then, even if they are given the option to consent, they need to know exactly what data is being collected, who has access to it, how long it will be kept, security measures to keep it private, etc. Will they be able to get the data out of the system if they request it at any time? Will the data be given to another institution later, if they transfer?  My university has a different version of this: we are encouraged to submit an ""early alert"" report on students who stop coming to class or are failing or are showing worrisome signs of mental distress (e.g., students who say they are considering suicide). I always tell students if I'm going to submit such an alert, and what it means. I tell them who has access to the information and how it is used (only a few people, and only to follow up with offers of resources for help). I only use it for situations when I have tried to work with the student and they are not responding, or there is indication of imminent danger to themselves. Still, I feel a bit uncomfortable at times because they can't get their records cleared if they want, later, so far as I know. And I don't know how long the records are kept. But at least this is not following every student, all the time."

The amount of time and money spent on making sure there are walls is enormous. Much harder than just making it available. That's what you have to do if you want to monetize knowledge. But should it be monetized at all? Big philosophical question...I think most of the time ""no,"" but then again what about literature? Yikes, this is a hard question! Still, I hate how hard it is to access knowledge in different institutions and countries based in part of lack of money, in part on politics."

Meaning, I'm not sure that filters need to be so bad for my elementary-school-aged-son. I don't know what filters those would be, exactly, and I'm sure however we try to do it it will leave out things that are useful and important (like Cummings and Dickinson). But I really don't want him running into violent, oppressive, cruel, misogynist porn (for example). I'm not against pornography when done in a way that respects all and shows voluntariness, etc., but I'd not want him to run into the other stuff unexpectedly until he's a bit older and can think about it more carefully and understand what it is and how it's a problem. That's just one example.   So for higher ed and high school, e.g., I am not sure we should be filtering at all. For elementary school, maybe so. I don't have answers as to when it should stop, or what it should be like. It's just that I see a bit of a complication here."
